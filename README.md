##### Abstract

Predicting the severeness of the disease of a patient could have a significant impact on the methods and treatment plans that should be done to cure a patient. Data gathered from clinical treatments and other studies can be used in order to use for the purpose of survival analysis. These data are usually high-dimensional, censored and contain missing information which brings about the need for methods which can overcome these challenges. Machine learning techniques because of their potential to estimate complex functions and overcome those challenges have recently received remarkable attention. In this paper, we run experiments and use different classes of machine learning models that have been developed for this purpose. We discuss about these classes and compare some instances of
them. Also, we analyze the importance of features in our analysis.
